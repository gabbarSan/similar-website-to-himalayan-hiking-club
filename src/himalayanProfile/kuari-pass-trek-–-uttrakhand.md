sectionOverviewDescription: Kuari Pass trek in the Garhwal district of
  Uttarakhand is famous for the spectacular views of the twin peaks of Nanda
  Devi, Hathi- Ghori Parbat, icy- crest Donagiri, Changbang and Trishul. The
  trek route passes amidst forests of Oakwood, Rhododendron and pine trees,
  making it a delightful trek for the nature lovers. The trek is also fondly
  called Lord Curzon's trail. Kuari Pass trek starts from Joshimath and over a
  period of 5 days takes you through Tali, Khulara and ultimately Kuari Pass.
  This is a picturesque trek and a great one for beginners, as the distance
  covered every day is manageable even by a first timer. Being a summer trek,
  Kuari Pass would offer you great views of the local flora and fauna, making
  your experience even more memorable. The Kuari Pass Trek gives you a chance to
  view this impressive skyline of these mighty mountains from close quarters.

      meadows (popular for skiing) and witness up-close views of the famous
      Nanda Devi Peak and other big Himalayan giants. After walking past the
      Auli meadows, we will trek through an enchanting mixed forest abundant in
      bird life. Once out of the jungle we will walk on the beautiful meadows of
      Gurson, every moment in this place is going to delightful. Beauty of these
      meadows is something to be experienced. From Gurson we will descend for a
      short time and will again enter a beautiful forest section of oaks,
      deodars, maple and chestnut trees. Trekking further, we will cross Tali, a
      campsite used by avid trekkers. In about a couple of hours, we will reach
      the magnificent campsite at Khulara where we camp for the night. If it's a
      clear night star gazing is going to be fun. Overnight in tents.

    description: Today we go through a series of ascents on meadows which keep on
      getting better as we move up. Walking on golden, green and other hues of
      grass is just bliss. The mountain air is crisp and the views brilliant! We
      are sure to catch a shepherd with the sheep and the dog. Don’t miss a
      chance to spend some time with them. The views are going to be great
      throughout so we keep our cameras handy. We will reach Kuari pass in about
      3 hours or so. Our guide might give you the option of not going to the
      actual pass (which is nearby) and instead climb another vantage point with
      better views so take a call depending upon what you feel like doing. After
      spending sometime at the vantage ridge/Kuari pass we will start walking
      back to Khulara. On reaching Khulara, we will enjoy an overnight stay in
      tents
