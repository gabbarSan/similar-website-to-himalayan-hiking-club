    heading: "Day 1: Arrival at Sankri"
    description: The exotic and fascinating Kedarkantha Trek commences from Dehradun
      city. The trekkers for the trip should reach Dehradun on the day before
      the trip commences or before 6am of the commencing date. The trekkers will
      be received warmly by the authorized personal from Dehradun at 6:30am for
      a onward journey to Sankri. Sankri is located at a distance of 220kms on
      the National Highway 123. It’s a long scenic drive on a Tata Sumo or a
      similar vehicle providing absolute comfort to the trekkers so that they
      can enjoy the beauty of the location. It is the scenic surroundings which
      increases the pleasure of reaching the destination and exhilarates the joy
      of the thrilling tour that remains yet to be experienced. The journey is a
      long one and takes about evening to reach the destination. In the midst
      one can enjoy the lunch break at the popular eateries having some local
      food and homemade spices. The last 22 kms to Sankri is all the more
      exciting since it travels through Govind National Park which is famous for
      its avid collection of flora typical of this region and not found in any
      other location of the country. The expected time to reach Sankri is 5 pm
      but since in some areas the roads are a little bumpy and rough, the time
      can be a little longer. However on reaching the destination one can check
      in to the prior booked hotel and our representative can help with the
      check in formalities. After freshening up, since the evening is free for
      leisure one can enjoy indoors and relax or can set out to explore the
      beautiful Sankri village where there are local shops and small market
      selling mostly daily goods and a collection of few dhabas. The BSNL
      network is quite erratic here so getting the phone lines can be a little
      difficult. However the scenic beauty of the setting sun on the Greater
      Himalayas from Sankri is a fabulous sight to savor. One can have dinner at
      the hotel premises or can enjoy dinner at the dhabas to taste some local
      flavors and experience the cuisine of the area. Overnight stay at the
      hotel.

    heading: "Day 2: Sankri to Juda-ka-Talab"
    description: Though the tour starts from Dehradun but the trekking trip
      commences from Sankri only. Having an early start after a healthy
      breakfast at the hotel it’s a journey straight towards Juda Ka Talab which
      is based at an altitude of 9100 feet. It’s a 4km trekking journey and the
      approximate time for reaching the same is around 5 hours. The journey
      begins by moving out of Sankri village through an extension called Sor.
      Once the village is crossed the road takes a wide curve and climbs
      sharply. Moving along the stream this is the road that moves towards the
      Kedarkantha. The initial climb would be climbing several bridges through
      dense forest trees and thick carpet of maple and pine leaves all brown in
      color. It’s an exquisite vision and a pictorial view that leaves all
      mesmerized. The trail is wide and one can hear the sounds of running
      streams all through but may not be in view till much further. On the way
      one can view remote villages where women and kids are found carrying
      bundles of wooden logs, wooden sticks and dry leaves to utilize them for
      household cooking and setting up night fire. While crunching the dried
      maple and oak leaves on the way up one can also view Himalayan Languars
      swinging from one branch of trees to another. Though they are somewhat a
      shy animal it’s difficult to have a gallant view of them as they move
      quickly from the vision’s range. Apart from this, boars, martens and hares
      can also be spotted in this region. The scenario however changes a lot in
      the summer months when the luscious meadows remain verdant green with
      hilly flowers of unique kind. Crossing few streams and continuing through
      the trail and rising sharp through dense oaks one can reach the beautiful
      pictorial spot of Jadu Ka Talab which can never be missed by any trekker
      due to its sharp contrasting and unique beauty. Jadu Ka talab is a too
      perfect a destination. The sharp contrast of a giant lake on the left and
      thick pine and oak forest on the right is a fascinating setting the lap of
      Mother Nature and an ideal campsite to spend a perfect evening. One can
      engage in activities like photography or nature walk to explore the area
      at the best. At the night time campfire can also be a good idea to share
      the light supper some warm drinks underneath the clear sky. The night sky
      however is a treat to the eyes with bright and shining stars creating a
      magnificent aura which is enjoyable for all trekkers. Overnight sleep is
      arranged in tents.

    heading: "Day 3: Juda-ka-Talab to Kedarkantha Base"
    description: The intoxicating journey continues day where the trekkers are
      destined to trek towards Kedarkantha base which lies at an altitude of 11,
      250 feet. The distance from Jadu Ka Talab to this destination is about
      4kms and in a moderate speed it takes about 2.5 hours to reach the place.
      After having the morning breakfast set out for the next journey where the
      trail is somewhat straight forward and quite visible. The track again
      begins through dense forests of pine and oak trees only and through steep
      ridge and much more dense areas. In this trail one will come across many
      shepherd huts in open meadows which are equally delightful to see. At an
      altitude of about 10,400 feet one can visualize traces of snow in and
      around the track only if it is the winter months trekking. With winding
      roads meandering through dry oak forests, stretched meadows and through
      lanes around shepherd huts the trail continues to Kedarkantha Base. In the
      midst one can take a long break to reenergize the body and get the
      enthralling view of natural extravaganza in the area. Just before reaching
      the Kedarkantha Base one can enjoy the fascinating views of arc shaped
      range of snow clapped mountains comprising of Bandarpoonch, Swargarohini,
      Kala Nag and Ranglana standing out proudly showcasing their beauty. After
      reaching the base, set up the tent in a preferred selected place which is
      open and one can enjoy a clear view of the night sky. However it is
      advisable to be based in close group rather than in much scattered way in
      the dark. The evening sky is equally beautiful with glowing stars and
      shining planets ornamenting the sun. As the night grows the sight becomes
      more charming with the Milky way stretching from one end to the other, the
      dense network of stars and glistening peak of the mountain all come
      together to provide an awe striking view that remains imprinted in mind.
      However in such a height it is possible to cold waves so proper woolens
      should be carried for protection. Overnight sleep at the tent.

      and then again descending back till Hargaon camp which is based at 8900
      feet. The total journey comprises of 6kms altogether and takes about 7
      hours of time in a moderate speed. Ideally it is a long day but the

      again cover a few portions of oak forest but the journey through this
      trail is much easier and faster. Climbing through the forest till its end
      , one can find the Kedarkantha peak much closer. Towards the end of the
      trail and close to the top the trek becomes a little difficult and can be
      a little strenuous especially for the first time trekkers. However the
      view from the top and the amazing location is worth the effort. At the top
      of the peak there is a beautiful yet small temple dedicated to Lord Shiva
